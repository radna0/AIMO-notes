1988-15,"In an office at various times during the day, the boss gives the secretary a letter to type, each time putting the letter on top of the pile in the secretary's in-box. When there is time, the secretary takes the top letter off the pile and types it. There are nine letters to be typed during the day, and the boss delivers them in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. While leaving for lunch, the secretary tells a colleague that letter 8 has already been typed, but says nothing else about the morning's typing. The colleague wonders which of the nine letters remain to be typed after lunch and in what order they will be typed. Based upon the above information, how many such after-lunch typing orders are possible? (That there are no letters left to be typed is one of the possibilities.)",704

2004-I-4,A square has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k.$ Find $100k.$,86
2011-I-14,"Let $A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 A_7 A_8$ be a regular octagon.  Let $M_1$ , $M_3$ , $M_5$ , and $M_7$ be the midpoints of sides $\overline{A_1 A_2}$ , $\overline{A_3 A_4}$ , $\overline{A_5 A_6}$ , and $\overline{A_7 A_8}$ , respectively.  For $i = 1, 3, 5, 7$ , ray $R_i$ is constructed from $M_i$ towards the interior of the octagon such that $R_1 \perp R_3$ , $R_3 \perp R_5$ , $R_5 \perp R_7$ , and $R_7 \perp R_1$ .  Pairs of rays $R_1$ and $R_3$ , $R_3$ and $R_5$ , $R_5$ and $R_7$ , and $R_7$ and $R_1$ meet at $B_1$ , $B_3$ , $B_5$ , $B_7$ respectively.  If $B_1 B_3 = A_1 A_2$ , then $\cos 2 \angle A_3 M_3 B_1$ can be written in the form $m - \sqrt{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers.  Find $m + n$ .",37
