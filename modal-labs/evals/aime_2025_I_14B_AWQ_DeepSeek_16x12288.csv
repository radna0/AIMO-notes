Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.,70,1
"On $\triangle ABC$ points $A,D,E$, and $B$ lie that order on side $\overline{AB}$ with $AD=4, DE=16$, and $EB=8$. Points $A,F,G$, and $C$ lie in that order on side $\overline{AC}$ with $AF=13, FG=52$, and $GC=26$. Let $M$ be the reflection of $D$ through $F$, and let $N$ be the reflection of $G$ through $E$. Quadrilateral $DEGF$ has area 288. Find the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$.",588,2
"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$, where both $x$ and $y$ are integers between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive, such that $12x^{2}-xy-6y^{2}=0$.",117,4
"There are $8!=40320$ eight-digit positive integers that use each of the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ exactly once. Let $N$ be the number of these integers that are divisible by 22. Find the difference between $N$ and 2025.",279,5
"Let $k$ be real numbers such that the system $|25+20i-z|=5$ and $|z-4-k|=|z-3i-k|$ has exactly one complex solution $z$. The sum of all possible values of $k$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$. Here $i=\sqrt{-1}$.",77,8
"The parabola with equation $y=x^{2}-4$ is rotated $60^{\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin. The unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect has $y$-coordinate $\frac{a-\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, and $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime. Find $a+b+c$.",62,9
"A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by $f(x)=\begin{cases}x&\text{if }x\in[-1,1)\\2-x&\text{if }x\in[1,3)\end{cases}$ and $f(x+4)=f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern. The parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. The sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points can be expressed in the form $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, $a,b,$ and $d$ have greatest common divisor equal to 1, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c+d$.",259,11
"Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters intersecting at the center of the disk. He draws 25 more line segments through the disk, drawing each segment by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting those two points. Find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.",204,13
"Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon with $AB=14, BC=7, CD=24, DE=13, EA=26,$ and $\angle B=\angle E=60^\circ$. For each point $X$ in the plane, define $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX+EX$. The least possible value of $f(X)$ can be expressed as $m+n\sqrt{p}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",60,14
