I want our plans to be preceding one another - that for example means:  a trained model will always be used for the next steps - potentially means no RL before SFT, so for our weekly plan around 7 weeks/48 days.



# 1. 10/02 -> 16/02
```
- Run Initial/Simple Evals - V
- Setup Basic SFT Training Script
- Train SFT on smaller datasets LIMO, s1K, etc..
- Run Evals again to test scaling effectiveness

Extras:
- Setup Basic RL Training Script
- Experiment with RL Training
- Optimizations such as Backtracking for perf - vLLM Updates/SGLang for speed
- Setup Synthetic Data Curation Pipeline
```
# 2. 17/02 -> 23/02
```

```
# 3. 24/02 -> 02/03
```

```
# 4. 03/03 -> 09/03
```

```
# 5. 10/03 -> 16/03
```

```
# 6. 17/03 -> 23/03
```

```
# 7. 24/03 -> 31/03
```

```
